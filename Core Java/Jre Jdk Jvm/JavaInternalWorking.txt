Basic Steps to execute Java Program
1. First and formost create a file and save it with .java extension.
2. Then write the java code as shown below.

Test.java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[] ) {
        System.out.println("Namaskara Tulunadu");
    }
}

3. Compile the Java class  via Java Compiler (javac).
javac Test.java

4. Now the Byte code has been generated.

5. To execute/run the code.
java Test

6. When you run above code you get the output.

Internal working

JVM
***
After compilation Byte code (.class file) is generated.
which is  passed to Jvm.
There are some components in Jvm.
                ---------------------------------------------
                JVM = ClassLoader + Memory + Execution Engine
                ----------------------------------------------

1. ClassLoader --> used to load the .class file into the memory
    a. Bootstrap ClassLoader
    b. Extension ClassLoader
    c. System/App ClassLoader
2. Memory
    a. Class(Method) Area --> used to store the class structure
    b. Heap Area --> used to store the Object
    c. Stack Area --> used to store local variable. It is created each time when method is
    invoked and destroy when method invocation completes.
    d. Programm Counter Register --> stores the address of Jvm instruction being executed.
    e. Native Method Stack --> contains all native code used in application.
3. Execution Engine
        a. Interpreter --> It reads the code line by line.
        b. Jit  -->  It means Just-in-Time Compiler. It convert byte code into machine code.
        It improves the Java program performance.

JRE
***
It contains JVM and class Libraries(java.lang, java.util and java.net classes etc)
                ---------------------------
                JRE = JVM + Class Libraries
                ---------------------------

JDK
***
It contains JRE, compiler, debugger and other development tools.
                ----------------------
                JDK = JRE + Dev tools
                ----------------------
